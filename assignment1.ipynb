    "There are thousands of individual risky assets in which HMC can invest.  Explain why MV optimization across 1,000 securities is infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generated the covariance matrix is hard - will have a lot of noise and be ill fitting\n",
    "    - to make it full rank we need to have a month for each entry so for 1000 things we need 1000 month's of data\n",
    "- MV optimization is highly sensitive to estimation error, and this sensitivity increases roughly with the square of the number of assets.\n",
    "- Will require a lot of leverage having large positive and negative weights\n",
    "\n",
    "- you don't want to invert a 1,000 x 1,000 matrix\n",
    "    - will be super unstable, super sensitive to like one touch the mu is not accurate so this will blow up the noise\n",
    "    - what is making the determenint big is that there is a lot of cros correlation in this matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.\n",
    "Rather than optimize across all securities directly, HMC runs a two-stage optimization.\n",
    "1. They build asset class portfolios with each one optimized over the securities of the specific asset class.  \n",
    "2. HMC combines the asset-class portfolios into one total optimized portfolio.\n",
    "In order for the two-stage optimization to be a good approximation of the full MV-optimization on all assets, what must be true of the partition of securities into asset classes?\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. \n",
    "Why does HMC focus on real returns when analyzing its portfolio allocation? Is this just a matter of scaling, or does using real returns versus nominal returns potentially change the MV solution?\n",
    "- HMC focuses on real returns because its objective is to preserve and grow the real purchasing power of the endowment.\n",
    "- This is not merely a scaling issue: if inflation is stochastic and correlated with asset returns, then both expected returns and covariances change when moving from nominal to real returns.\n",
    "- Consequently, the mean–variance efficient frontier and the optimal portfolio weights can differ — particularly increasing allocations to assets that hedge inflation risk, such as TIPS and real estate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.\n",
    "The case discusses the fact that Harvard places bounds on the portfolio allocation rather than implementing whatever numbers come out of the MV optimization problem.\n",

    "### 6. \n",
    "Exhibits 5 shows zero allocation to domestic equities and domestic bonds across the entire computed range of targeted returns, (5.75% to 7.25%). Conceptually, why is the constraint binding in all these cases? What would the unconstrained portfolio want to do with those allocations and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.\n",
    "Exhibit 6 changes the constraints, (tightening them in most cases.) How much deterioration do we see in the mean-variance tradeoff that Harvard achieved?"
